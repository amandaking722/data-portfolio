# Final Project 

## Part One

My final project will visualize the effects of climate change on our planet, and point to its cause: the "greenhouse effect." 

### Outline

Specifically, my story will show how increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from energy consumption has led to climate change. The major elements of my story will be the:

1. Set-Up
* The story will open with the start of the long-lived forcing of climate change–how humans have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide   (CO2) concentration more than one third since the Industrial Revolution. 
* Through a bar chart, I'll show how energy consumption from 1990 to present day has increased CO2 emissions.
  
2. Conflict
* In this section, we'll discuss and show the effects of climate change on our planet. This will highlight dynamic visuals of the need for the environmental movement in the 1970s.
* I'll next reveal the grave impact of climate change by showing photos of the fires in the Amazon and increased natural disasters, such as hurricanes.
 
3. Resolution
* Yet, it's not all grim. I'll go into what people are doing to combat climate change, such as the Paris Climate Agreement and the youth climate strikes. Data on CA's plans to decrease greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030 will support this.
* I'll conclude with a call to action that asks the audience to do something about global warming.

### Initial Sketches

### The Data 

I plan to incorporate data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, specifically data from the [U.S. Energy-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions, 2017 report](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/carbon/). The data analyzes emissions from 1990 - 2017, which I plan to visualize through a bar chart. I'll also create a line graph based on data from energy-related CO2 emissions by end-use sectors including transportation, residential, industrial and commercial. 

In addition, i'll utilize a line graph of data from [California's plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=34792). I also plan to cite the following articles that point to the causes and impacts of climate change:

* [The Causes of Climate Change](https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/)
* [The Environmental Movement](https://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/ecology-and-environmentalism/environmental-studies/environmental-movement)
* [10 things you can do about climate change](https://davidsuzuki.org/what-you-can-do/top-10-ways-can-stop-climate-change/)

### Method and Medium

Now that I have my data, outline and sketches, I'll create wireframes, storyboard and moodboards. During these steps, i'll write my copy about the narrative and the call to action. Next, i'll source dynamic photography of energy sources that release CO2 emissions, and photos of people taking action during the Environmental Movement all the way up through present day with the recent youth climate marches. These visuals will accompany the text.

I'll then conduct user research and incorporate their feedback into my project. I can now begin to build the data visualizations using RAWGraphs, Tableu and Infogram. Afterwards, I'll start to lay out the text, images and graphics on Shorthand. Finally, I'll present my project to the class in the form of a 60-second lightning talk. 

## Part Two

### User Research Protocol  

## Target Audience

Through my online story, I hope to reach people interested in learning about the causes of climate change and its impacts, as well as those who want to take action to mitigate its impact. These could vary in age from teenagers to senior citizens.

For user testing, I plan to interview my fiancé Josh, my colleague Aiswariya and my brother Matt. These individuals are all concerned about the effects of climate change and are taking action in either their personal and/or professional lives to decrease their carbon footprint. Aiswariya is a data scientist, so she will be helpful in providing feedback on the data visualizations. She also works in the energy sector and will understand the topic. Josh and Matt don't work in energy so i'm hoping they can provide feedback on anything that might be confusing, or needs elaborated on more.

### Interview Script 

1. Did you learn anything new? (Goal: Evaluate audience's takeaways)
2. What is confusing, if anything? (Evaluate content)
3. Should I improve any text, photography and/or data visualizations? (Improve content)
4. Would you take any of the steps mentioned at the end to combat climate change? (Evaluate Call-to-Action)

## Mood Board

Next, I created a mood board (pictured below) to identify examples of what has worked well when visualizing similar datasets, as well as themes in color, typography, and visuals. The color palette via ColorBrewer reflects cool, earthy tones. The photos from left to right show industry emissions, what appears to be a gas pipeline in a desserted, dry area, an electric vehicle and youth marching for action against climate change. They are all very dymanic, and represent the tone of my story. In the data visualization, I found the pie chart with the infographics to be visually appealing and easy to read.

## Initial Wireframes

I created [my wireframes](https://balsamiq.cloud/spyvd1y/phpvtm5) using Balsamiq. In the sketches, I mocked up my text, images and used placeholder data visualizations.



### Interview Findings

1. Did you learn anything new? (Goal: Evaluate audience's takeaways)

In general, Josh gave me a lot of great feedback. While he said he didn't learn anything new in terms of big picture, he learned about the specific data points I mentioned in my story.

I was surprised to see that Aiswariya learned two new things: The timeline of responses to climate change (a great addition), and thehe emissions bar chart from 1990-2017, which helped to put the issue in perspective. She recommended that while the stories of Greenland’s icecaps melting and the Amazon fires are critical to explaining climate change, they are stories that we saw on the news a lot. If time permits, she said she recommends including more unpopular yet hard-hitting facts about climate change.

2. What is confusing, if anything? (Evaluate content)

Josh and Aiswariya said the visualizations were confusing without the actual data and descriptions.

3. Should I improve any text, photography and/or data visualizations? (Improve content)

Josh and Aiswariya both said they wanted to understand the data more. Specifically, they found it difficult to understand the charts in the absence of descriptions. Aiswariya recommended, "If you could add a colored version of both charts with labels and scales, that would increase the readability of the charts."

Josh also mentioned that I have a lot of text and recommended I added more visuals. Aiswariya had specific feedback on this: "The first picture is always the hook! I recommend a more compelling picture right at the beginning. The factory smoke picture and related content would follow this “hook” image." She also mentioned, "Stories like Greenland’s ice caps melting and Amazon fires, while critical to explaining climate change, are stories that we were on the news a lot. If time permits, I’d recommend including more unpopular yet hard-hitting facts about climate change." In addition, Matt let me know that "bar" was misspelled in my graph. Overall, he really liked the sketches.

4. Would you take any of the steps mentioned at the end to combat climate change? (Evaluate Call-to-Action)

Josh said he is already taking most of the steps I mentioned and he said he wants to see something that would make him feel invested in the steps. He recommended I add visuals to this section. He also advised me to make this section more exciting by using an impactful stat of say, how many plastic bottles go into the ocean each year. However, Aiswariya said she felt that the CTA steps were simple, yet practical.

### Implemented Changes

In my revised wireframes (below), I made edits to the text and photos. In the text, I shortened the title of my story by a few words and fixed the aforementioned spelling error. I decided to not follow Josh's advice in eliminating the text. I think it would "oversimplify" this topic, that needs some context since it's science-related. 

I took Aiswariya's advice to add photography and text about more unknown evidence of climate change. I added a photo of flooding along the Arkansas River and accompanying text about increased numbers of intense rainfall and record high temperature events. I also added a more dynamic photo of glaciers melting right at the beginning of teh story.

Finally, I created the bar chart of U.S. Energy-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions From 1990-2017 in order to eliminate confusion over the data. I plan to add labels and a sub-header in Part III.
