# Final Project 

My final project will visualize the effects of climate change on our planet, and point to its cause: the "greenhouse effect." 

# Outline

1. Set-Up
  a. The story will open with the start of the long-lived forcing of climate change--how humans have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide   (CO2) concentration more than one third since the Industrial Revolution. 
  
2. Conflict
 
3. Resolution



# The Data 

I plan to incorporate data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, specifically data from the U.S. Energy-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions, 2017 report: https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/carbon/. The data analyzes emissions from 1990 - 2017, which I plan to visualize through a bar chart. I'll also create a line graph based on data from energy-related CO2 emissions by end-use sectors including transportation, residential, industrial and commercial. In addition to data sets like these, I plan to cite these sources that point to the causes and impacts of climate change.

          The Causes of Climate Change https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/
          The Environmental Movement https://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/ecology-and-environmentalism/environmental-studies/environmental-movement
          David Suzuki Foundation on 10 things you can do about climate change: https://davidsuzuki.org/what-you-can-do/top-10-ways-can-stop-climate-change/

# Method and Medium

Now that I have my data, outline and sketches, I'll create the wireframes, storyboard and moodboards. During this step, i'll write my copy about the narrative and the call to action. Next, i'll source dynamic photography of energy sources that release CO2 emissions, and photos of people taking action during the Environmental Movement all the way up through present day with the recent climate strikes. These visuals will accompany the text.

I'll then conduct user research and incorporate user feedback into my project. I can now begin to build the data visualizations using RAWGraphs, Tableu and Infogram. Afterwards, I'll start to lay out the text, images and graphics on Shorthand. Finally, I'll present my project to the class in the form of a 60-second lightning talk.
